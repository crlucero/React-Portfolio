# Portfolio

## Description

This is my updated portfolio using React. I added state functionality by creating an 'Admin' component. The admin can update my list of projects by filling out the form and navigating to my 'portfolio' page. The added projects are only held until the page is refreshed. State currently resides in the main app and is passed into PortfolioList and NewProjectControl components
